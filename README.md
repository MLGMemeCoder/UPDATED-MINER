## The *Updated* Mattcoin Miner
This miner will use your computational resources for the Mattcoin network in exchange for some
MTC blocks. Once a successful block is mined you will receive a notification telling you the block you mined along with a miners reward. You can verify by using https://mattcoin.now.sh/api/v1/crypto/block/block-id-here . This is the only way Mattcoins are created and will
never be added by an admin.

```bash
